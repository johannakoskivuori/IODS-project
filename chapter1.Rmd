I am a PhD student in the School of Pharmacy, UEF. I am doing metabolomics studies in my PhD thesis and I have a huge amount of data to be analyzed. I chose this course to get some new tools for analyzing and visualizing my data. I have used R in a couple of basic statistics courses but I wish to learn some new tricks in this course.
